 <property>
   <name>hbase.cluster.distributed</name>
   <value>true</value>
   <description>The mode the cluster will be in. Possible values are
     false: standalone and pseudo-distributed setups with managed Zookeeper
     true: fully-distributed with unmanaged Zookeeper Quorum (see hbase-env.sh)

     <description>Comma separated list of servers in the ZooKeeper Quorum.
     For example, "host1.mydomain.com,host2.mydomain.com,host3.mydomain.com".
     By default this is set to localhost for local and pseudo-distributed modes of operation. For a fully-distributed setup, this should be set to a full list of ZooKeeper quorum servers. If HBASE_MANAGES_ZK is set in hbase-env.sh this is the list of servers which we will start/stop ZooKeeper on.
